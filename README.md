# Rustedis

Basic web-based key-value store implemented in Rust.

## Description

Rustedis is a simple implementation of an API-based key-value store (like Redis).

I'm using this as a way to learn Rust from the beginning. The code is subject to change, but will always remain in a usable state on the `main` branch.
